CocoaGNUt
=========

An open-source implementation of the UIKit and CoreGraphics Libraries

To use these libraries, you must have iPhone app source code to test it with.
Add the include and lib files to your classpath and then compile the app with clang and the lib-objc2 libraries.
Also, make sure that you have GNUStep installed and in your classpath.

Most apps will break, but very simple ones can demonstrate the functionality.
I will put a few and some simple test scripts in here when I get a chance. For now, it is just a straight dump of the libaries.
